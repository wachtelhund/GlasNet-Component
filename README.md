# GlasNet-Component
Program made to calculate prices of glazed windows for customers, this is in production.
It uses the embed function of the sitebuilder. This is the reason that the JS is embeded in the html doc. The sitebuilder itself also provides some/all of the styling of the component, I've done this by inspecting the original page and using thier styleclasses on some of the elements of my component.
