# GlasNet-Component
Program made to calculate prices of glazed windows for customers, this is in production.

It uses the embed function of the sitebuilder. This is the reason that the JS is embeded in the html doc. 

The sitebuilder itself also provides some/all of the styling of the components. I've done this by inspecting the original page and using thier styleclasses on some of the elements of my component.

There are several similar components used on the website in question but I've chosen not to include those. The reason for this is that it works in similar ways. However the other components calculate in more detail and include different type of extra options and aticles which include pricing that should be kept private.

Here's an example of one of the other component. This one is used to calculate the price and measurements of a specified glass roof.
